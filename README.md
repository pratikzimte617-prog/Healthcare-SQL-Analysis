Healthcare Efficiency: SQL Emergency Room Analysis
Project Overview
This project uses SQL to analyze over 10,000 hospital records. The goal was to identify bottlenecks in patient triage and find the correlation between wait times and patient satisfaction.

Key SQL Techniques Used
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): To organize complex wait-time calculations.

Case Statements: To bucket patients into wait-time brackets.

Aggregations: To calculate average scores across different hospital departments.

Business Impact
Discovery: Identified that 'Respiratory' cases wait 20% longer than 'General' cases.

Recommendation: Proposed a staffing shift during peak hours (6 PM - 10 PM) to reduce critical wait times.# Healthcare-SQL-Analysis
SQL analysis of hospital patient flow and emergency room efficiency to optimize wait times.
